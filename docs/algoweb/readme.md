<h2>Introduction</h2>
Review of the lecture notes for the course of Web algorithmics, held by professor <a href="https://vigna.di.unimi.it/">Sebastiano Vigna</a> at <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/unimi/">Universit√† degli studi di Milano</a>, the lecture notes are in italian and are updated to the end of last year.

They are still a very viable option for all the students that take the course.

I consider this project to be a good showcase of my abilities in the field of LaTeX typesetting, if compared to my <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/bachelor/readme/">bachelor thesis</a> I think that this project is more polished and refined.
