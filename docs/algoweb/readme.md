<h2>Introduction</h2>
Review of the lecture notes for the course of Web algorithmics, held by professor Sebastiano Vigna at Universit√† degli studi di Milano, the lecture notes are in italian and are updated to the end of last year.

They are still a very viable option for all the students that take the course.

I consider this project alongside my other project for the course of Discrete Structures 1 to be a good showcase of my abilities with the LaTeX language. To see the latest revision of the notes just follow the link below.
