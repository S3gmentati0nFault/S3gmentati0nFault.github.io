I am currently working on my first publication ever, which will be published in the Engineering
Applications of Neural Networks journal for 2025, it's a very important step for me because I am
being more and more drawn towards the world of scientific research and understanding how to write
and publish my work was something that really hyped me.

The article will be published under the title 'Quench detection and localization via interpretable
machine learning', and it focuses on the work that I have been doing on the high order corrector
superconducting magnets that will be mounted at CERN. Our objective was to find explainable machine
learning models capable of abstracting the concept of quench transition (a superconductor quenches
when the resistance of the material suddendly moves from 0 to a real non-zero value) and predicting
it with high accuracy.

These models needed not only to understand when the material quenches, but also localize the coil(s)
that underwent the transition within the magnet.
