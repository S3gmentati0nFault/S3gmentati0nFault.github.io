I began my master in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.unimi.it/en">University of Milan</a> in September 2022 wanting to focus on web development, distributed systems and cloud technologies.

After some time I discovered the existence of other fields, like machine learning, and I fell in love with the idea of finally applying computer science as an instrument to support research in other fields. I started my thesis in September 2024 and it's titled "Supervised machine learning techniques for quench detecction in superconductors" followed by professor <a href="https://malchiodi.di.unimi.it/">Dario Malchiodi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucio_Rossi">Lucio Rossi</a>.

My university curriculum is a mix of theoretical computer science, with the following courses:

- Algoritmi e complessit√† (Algorithms and Complexity) - A course about advanced algorithms.

- Metodi probabilistici per l'informatica (Probabilistic methods for computer science) - A course about Markov Chains and their applications.

- Algoritmica per il web (web algorithmics) - A course about the latest technologies in the field of web algorithmics.

- Heuristic Algorithms - A course about heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms.

distributed systems, with the following courses:

- Distributed and pervasive systems

- GPU computing

- Cloud computing Technologies

and some other misc courses like:

- Calcolo numerico (Numerical Analysis) - A course about numerical methods for solving various problems.

- Reti wireless and mobili (Mobile and wireless networks)

- Fisica degli acceleratori 1 (Accelerator physics 1)

- Artificial intelligence

- Videogame design and programming
