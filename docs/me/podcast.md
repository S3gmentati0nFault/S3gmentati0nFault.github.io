At the end of 2021 me and my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alin-tomulet/">Alin Tomulet</a> decided to start a joint project to talk about cool stuff on the air. I always wanted to do something radio-like but all the previous projects I tried did non work out.

We started recording episodes in my room and we were able to start inviting some friends over as guests after just a couple of episodes. All of the episodes were around the hour mark and we usually talked about topics that were in the field of technology, startups and innovation. We invited people like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrorisaro/">Alessandro Risaro</a> co-founder of the DataPizza startup, that is trying to create a connection between the italian tech industry and workers.

After around a year of recording and 10 episodes published we decided to merge with another podcast, that can still be found on Spotify. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/11kIqeinNDiluu7TpsYsEm">OVERHEAR</a> is a podcast that has been going on and off for a couple of years and was originally held by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommaso-lucarelli-ba4483177/">Tommaso Lucarelli</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-frosi-a377a1158/">Stefano Frosi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emabaldelli/">Emanuele Baldelli</a>, we came around for the fourth season of the podcast and we recorded a series of episodes with them, inviting professors some of the professors of the university of Milano (<a href="https://boldi.di.unimi.it/">Paolo Boldi</a>, <a href="https://vigna.di.unimi.it/">Sebastiano Vigna</a>, <a href="https://homes.di.unimi.it/quadri/">Christian Quadri</a>) among others.

Due to everyone in the group having different goals and different schedules unfortunately we had to stop the production of the podcast, but it was an amazing experience and an opportunity to do something great together with very talented people.
