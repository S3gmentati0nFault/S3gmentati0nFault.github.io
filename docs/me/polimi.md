I began my bachelor studies pursuing a degree in Computer engineering at <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en">Politecnico di Milano</a>. Unfortunately, due to the covid pandemic in 2020 and family hardships I chose to change university.

During the first two years of studying I went through the following exams:

- Calculus 1 and 2

- Algebra

- Advanced algebra and logic

- Foundamentals of Computer Science

- Architectures and Operating systems

- Foundamentals of control systems

- Physics 1

- Chemistry

- Algorithms and Data structures
