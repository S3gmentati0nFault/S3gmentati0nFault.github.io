<h2> Laguages </h2>

- Italian: mother tongue

The english level was certified many years ago through a First for english test and the result was B2. Since then, I have done a series of simpler tests (entrance english test for the university) that are non certifying and provided varying results (between C1 and C2). I am confident that the current level is C1.

- English: C1

Studied spanish many years ago but can still understand, read and speak about myself and some other topics. Some work would be required to reach a good level of proficiency.

- Spanish: A2

Interests:

- German

- French

<h2> Programming languages </h2>
The following are the programming languages that I know and the ones that I feel the more comfortable with, I am going to use the same scale used to describe natural languages to trace a parallel. Clearly there is no certification for any of the languages below, apart from the projects that I did.

- Java: C1

- Python: B2

- C: B1

- Cuda C: B1

- SQL: B1

- C++: A2

- C#: A2

- HTML / CSS / JS: A2

- Lua: A1

Interests:

- Go

- Rust

<h2> Frameworks, software and operating systems </h2>
In the following I will go over some of the software and frameworks that I use the most and I have used in my private or university projects.

<h3>Nvim</h3>
Recently discovered the power of this text editor and I am currently using it for most of my projects, still trying to get the hang of it though.

<h3>Zed</h3>
A more classic IDE written in Rust that I have been using instead of Visual Studio Code for some time now.

<h3>Git</h3>
Wouldn't consider myself proficient in the usage of git, but I can use it comfortably to manage my projects and work with other people.

<h3>LaTeX</h3>
I have been using LaTeX for many years and for many different projects, again, I would not define myself an expert in the field, but I can use it comfortably to manage all the documents that require a more professional look.

<h3>Obsidian</h3>
Discovered this software to take notes and link knowledge and I am trying to integrate it in my workflow in a meaningful way.

<h3>Goodnotes</h3>
My number one note taking app on the iPad.

<h3>Linux</h3>
I have been a die hard fan of the Linux ecosystem for many years now, I have been using many different distributions (from Void to Debian to Manjaro to Ubuntu) and I always learned something from every time I broke the system.

I am currently rocking a single boot Pop-OS! installation of my personal tower with which I do all of my work.

<h3>Mac OS</h3>
I have been using a 2014 Macbook Pro since 2022 and I am quite happy with it, I find the operating system amazing and the idea that I can handle all of my packages via terminal through the brew package manager is amazing.

<h3>Windows</h3>
I have used Windows for many years, I used to be comfortable with it until I started my university journey, had to switch to Linux to make sure I could work with things like the C compiler and other tools without headaches.
