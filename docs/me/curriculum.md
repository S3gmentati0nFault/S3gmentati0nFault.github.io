<h2> Projects </h2>
Instead of listing every project I have done here is a selection of my top 5 most important projects
in no particular order

- <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/mprjct/readme">My master thesis</a>

- <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/boruvka/readme/">Efficient solution for MST
  computation on sparse graphs</a>

<h2> Laguages </h2>

- Italian: native speaker

- English: C1

The english level was certified many years ago through a First for english test and the result was B2. Since then, I have done a series of simpler tests (entrance english test for the university) that are non certifying and provided varying results (between C1 and C2). I am confident that the current level is C1.

- Spanish: A2

Studied spanish many years ago but can still understand, read and speak about myself and some other topics. Some work would be required to reach a good level of proficiency.

- German: A1.2

Currently enrolled in a language school to achieve A1.2 don't have any certifications as of right
now.

Interests:

- French

<h2> Programming languages </h2>
To trace a parallel with the spoken languages I have taken a selection of the programming languages I feel most comfortable with and graded my knowledge based on the number of projects I have done with them, the years I have been using them for and the level of confidence I feel when coming back to them; the measurement is, of course, completely subjective,

- Java: C1

  I know how to work with Java, I used it a lot and I have done all of the introductory courses for programming with it and I developed the backend for my <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/bachelor/readme/">thesis</a> with it. Furthermore I know how to work with Threads and concurrency. I'm so confident with it that I chose it as my main programming language for the interviews I am taking.

- Python: B2

  I used Python for my master thesis, I never really studied the basis, but I moved directly to the use the classic data science stack, namely: <a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Sklearn</a>.

- C, C++, Cuda C: B2
  
  C was the first programming language I ever learned and C++ adopted me. I know the older standards for C++ but I would like to get to know some of the newer inventions for this language. On the side I also got to experiment with the Cuda C framework for my <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/boruvka/readme/">GPU computing project</a>

Interests:

- Go

- Rust

<h2> Frameworks, software and operating systems </h2>
In the following I will go over some of the software and frameworks that I use the most and I have used in my private or university projects.

<h3>Nvim</h3>
Recently discovered the power of this text editor and I am currently using it for most of my projects, still trying to get the hang of it though.

<h3>Git</h3>
Wouldn't consider myself proficient in the usage of git, but I can use it comfortably to manage my projects and work with other people.

<h3>LaTeX</h3>
I have been using LaTeX for many years and for many different projects, again, I would not define myself an expert in the field, but I can use it comfortably to manage all the documents that require a more professional look.

<h3>Linux</h3>
I have been using Linux dor many years, I experimented many different distributions and I understood their core logic (from Debian to Manjaro to PopOS!). I am currently running Arch Linux on my laptop and PopOS! on my tower. I am also beginning to work in the field of Servers using Proxmox.

<h3>Microsoft suite</h3>
While I do not use Windows usually I have used the Microsoft suite to create presentations and
sheets for personal projects for many years.
