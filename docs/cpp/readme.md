This project was written mainly in **C++**.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The project was assigned for the course of C++ programming at <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/unimib/">Universit√† degli studi Milano Bicocca</a> held by professor <a href="http://www.ivl.disco.unimib.it/people/gianluigi-ciocca/">Gianluigi Ciocca</a>.

The project consisted of two different assignements, one of common C++ programming in the field of data structures and the other required the implementation of a simple GUI using QT.

Down below you can find the description of the two assignements alongside a download of the documentation provided with the source code and generated using doxygen.
