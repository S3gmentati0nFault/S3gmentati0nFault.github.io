This project was a research paper written for the course of Cloud Computing Technologies held by
Professors Claudio Ardagna and Marco Anisetti at Universit√† degli studi di Milano.

The idea of the project came from me and was further expanded by me because I was captured by
something I read a while back which the following question was asked: "What if 5G was enough? Do we
really need 6G?".

My research is meant to do some paper-reviewing as well as try to explain the areas of major
interest in the field of distributed learning techniques (which I identify as the only solutions
currently available to handle in a timely fashion models as big as LLMs).

In the paper I go through the following steps:

* Introduction.

* 6G overview: using a whitepaper from Nokia, I go through the 6 key aspect of the new 6G
communication standard putting more emphasis on the fact that 6G should be a network that is shaped
to the user's need and liking and therefore it's going to make heavy use of AI approaches like
LLMs.

* Opportunities: I use this section to briefly expose opportunities that
have been identified in the literature and then I move to explaining my idea of the architecture,
that builds upon the spectrum distribution showed in the previous section.

* Technical limitations: I use this section to expose some of the evident problems connected to
the need of having LLMs stored in the network in locations that are as close as possible to the end
users and I also propose some solutions found in literature in the field of distributed learning
(Federated Learning, Split Learning and LoRA).
