Welcome on my portfolio website!

I'm a computer science student at the end of my master studies at <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/unimi/">Universit√† degli studi di Milano</a>, I started the master with the intention of exploring the field of distributed systems and cloud computing, I am now moving towards the field of applied machine learning after the course of Machine Learning for Physics held by professor Tilman Plehn at <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/erasmus/">Karl Ruprecht university of Heidelberg</a>.

I am in the process of starting my master Thesis titled "Supervised machine learning techniques for quench detection in superconductors" accompanied by professors Dario Malchiodi and Lucio Rossi.
