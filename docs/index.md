Welcome on my portfolio website!

I'm a doctor in computer science, just graduated from <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/unimi/">Universit√† degli studi di Milano</a>, I started the master with the intention of exploring the field of distributed systems and cloud computing, I am now moving towards the field of applied machine learning, after the course of Machine Learning for Physics, held by professor Tilman Plehn at <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/erasmus/">Karl Ruprecht university of Heidelberg</a>.

My master thesis was titled "Supervised machine learning techniques for quench detection in
superconductors" and I achieved an amazing result. At the moment I am still collaborating with my
advisor <a href="https://malchiodi.di.unimi.it/">Dario Malchiodi</a> and my co-advisor <a href="https://www.unimi.it/it/ugov/person/samuele-mariotto">Samuele
Mariotto</a> to further explore the consequences of our research (more information <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/mprjct">here</a>).


<h2> What am I looking for? </h2>
Now that my university journey has ended I'm trying to answer the question: 'What do I want from my future?'

At the moment I am exploring the possibilities of a PhD in computer science applied to the field of
physics, I am very interested in:

- Machine learning, deep learning and data science applied to complex scientific fields,

- GPU computing or efficient algorithm design (both sequential and parallel).
