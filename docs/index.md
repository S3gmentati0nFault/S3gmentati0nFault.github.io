Welcome on my portfolio website!

I'm a computer science student at the end of my master studies at University of Milan, I have been interested in past years in the field of distributed systems technologies and cloud environments, I am now moving towards the field of applied machine learning after the course of Machine Learning for Physics held by professor
Tilman Plehn at Karl Ruprecht university of Heidelberg.

I am in the process of starting my master Thesis titled "Supervised machine learning techniques for quench detecction in superconductors" accompanied by both professors Dario Malchiodi and Lucio Rossi.
