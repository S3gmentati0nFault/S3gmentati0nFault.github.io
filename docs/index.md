Welcome on my portfolio website!

I'm Alessndro Biagiotti, 25 years old from Italy, recently graduated from my Master's in computer science at <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/unimi/">Universit√† degli studi di Milano</a>, I started the master with the intention of exploring the field of distributed systems and cloud computing. I am now moving towards the field of applied machine learning and extremely parallelised systems, after rediscovering the love for Physics.

My master thesis was titled "Supervised machine learning techniques for quench detection in superconductors" and I we achieved interesting results which were worth publishing at a minor engineering paper. At the moment I am still collaborating with my advisor <a href="https://malchiodi.di.unimi.it/">Dario Malchiodi</a> and my co-advisor <a href="https://www.unimi.it/it/ugov/person/samuele-mariotto">Samuele Mariotto</a> to further explore the consequences of our research (more information <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/mprjct/readme/">here</a>).


<h2> What am I looking for? </h2>
Now that my university journey has ended I'm trying to answer the question: 'What do I want from my future?'

At the moment I am exploring the possibilities of a PhD in computer science applied to the field of
physics, I am very interested in:

- Machine learning, deep learning and data science applied to complex scientific fields,

- GPU computing or efficient algorithm design (both sequential and parallel).
