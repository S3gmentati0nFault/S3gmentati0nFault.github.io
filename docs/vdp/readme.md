<h2>Introduction</h2>
Pump down the flame was a project I developed alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federico-maglione-463358126/">Federico Maglione</a>, Fabio Patella and Nicol√≤ Fasulo to participate in the 2022 Videogame Design and Development course. The game was a 2d level-based platformer in which the objective was to save a series of hostages from terrorists before the time ran out and without dying.

The game was developed using Unity and the sprites were a mix of free asstes and assets created using midjourney and stable diffusion. The game was developed in a span of circa 3 months and was one of the most appreciated games of the course gaining us an overall 6th place out of 24 games and a final grade of 27/30.
