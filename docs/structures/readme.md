This project was written mainly in **LaTeX**.

<h2> Introduction </h2>
The idea behind this project was to provide students with an open source version of the notes for the course of Discrete Structures 1 held by professor <a href="https://web.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/tcs/granet">Bertille Granet</a> and professor <a href="https://web.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/tcs/joos"Felix Joos</a> at <a href="https://s3gmentati0nfault.github.io/me/erasmus/">University Karl Ruprecht of Heidelberg</a>, the notes are in english and have not been updated since the beginning of this year.

These notes are currently undergoing some maintenance, therefore the last pdf version is not in the best shape, a future release is bound to fix its appearance. The latest version of the notes can be downloaded at the link below.
